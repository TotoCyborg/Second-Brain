Since the 1990s (nineteen ninety) and the rise of **Web 2.0**, internet users are no longer just passive consumers: they now actively participate by creating and sharing content online.  
Web usage has expanded into several main areas:

 1. **Information Sharing** = Websites that allow users to share and update information collaboratively. For example Wikipedia provides general knowledge constantly updated by users, Wikitravel offers travel advice, and Wikileaks publishes confidential documents, often of political relevance;

2. **Social Networking** = Platforms such as **Facebook** and **Instagram**, allow users to create personal profiles, stay in touch with friends, share messages, music, videos, and photos, and make new connections with people around the world.

3. **Blogging** =  A **blog** is a personal site, similar to a digital diary, where the blogger regularly posts thoughts, info, and links. Most popular microblog is Twitter where you can share shorter and frequent posts;

4. **Shopping** = Online shops like **Amazon** or **iTunes**, and auction sites like **eBay**, allow users to buy and sell items easily. This method is cheaper, faster, and more convenient, but it also involves risks such as fraud and scams;

5. **Virtual Worlds and Gaming** =  Sites like **Second Life**, allow users to create avatars and interact with others in digital environments. These spaces offer a mix of social interaction, creativity, and entertainment, simulating aspects of real life in a virtual setting;

6. **Entertainment Sharing** = Sites like **YouTube** and **Spotify** give access to music and videos, usually through streaming. Some platforms also allow downloads. Instead, some illegal sites like CB01, distribute copyrighted material without permission.
