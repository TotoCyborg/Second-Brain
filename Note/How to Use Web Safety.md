Using the Internet is useful, but it can also be dangerous if we are not careful. Hackers, viruses, and other risks can damage our computer or steal our personal information. For this reason, it’s important to follow some simple rules to stay safe online. 

**Install a Firewall**

A firewall is a program or device that protects your computer. It checks the data coming from the Internet and blocks anything dangerous. This helps stop hackers and harmful software from entering your system. 

**Keep Software Up to Date**

Hackers often use bugs in old software to attack computers. That’s why it’s important to update your programs, like your browser, antivirus, and operating system. Updates fix problems and make your computer safer. 

 **Use Protection Programs**

Antivirus software checks emails and files for viruses and removes them. Anti-spyware stops programs that try to follow your online activity. Because new threats appear every day, it’s important to always use the latest versions. 

 **Take Care with E-mail**
 
Don’t open email attachments from people you don’t know. They can contain viruses. Avoid clicking on unknown links in emails they can be dangerous. Use a spam filter and never reply to spam messages, not even to unsubscribe.
