The rapid evolution of computer and Internet, is having an enormous impact on the world in which we live and has given rise to many questions about how this world will change. The following are some of the social and ==ethical issues== to emerge:

- ==Digital Divide==: there is a division in society between those who know how to use technology well and those who do not know these skills, mainly because of the economic gap and the level of education. So slder poorer, less educated people feel increasingly left behind;
- ==Interpersonal Relations==: the new methods of communication have changed how people relate to each other both at work and in private, paradoxically this fake social proximity has made us lose direct human contact making us more isolate;
- ==Information Overload==: the large amount of information on the internet makes it difficult to transcend which ones are true and which ones are not. This causes misinformation of users who no longer know what is true and what instead is written to attract attention;
- ==Censorship==: some people wont to keep the Internet as a place were anybody is free to publish anything. Others fear that allowing open access to controversial, subversive or imooral opinions or materials may have a damaging effect on society, especially on more vulnerable people such children;
- ==Surveillance==: the phone we always carry with us is one of the most sophisticated tracking systems ever invented and governments or companies could access this information for their own security or marketing purposes. Is it morally right that these public or state bodies have access to all our data or would it be better to protect our privacy by asserting our digital rights?
- ==Unemployment==: the development of new technologies in the world of work has its pros and cons. The advantage is that the invention of robots has automated production and reduced the costs of industries, the disadvantage is that these automations have taken away the work of many people, Creating new jobs in areas which did not exist before, such as automation managemen;
- ==Erosion of cultural industries==: digital technology can make perfect copies and then distribute them, this rivolutionary capacity is having a devastating effect on traditional mass media. The music and film industries first suffered from the drop in sales of CDs and DVDs and now they are forced to fight against piracy and the distribution of copies of songs and films in a free and illegal way;
