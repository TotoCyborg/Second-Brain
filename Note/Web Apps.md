**Traditional applications** are heavy programs that require a lot of memory and are used to perform general tasks (e.g., accounting or data processing).  
**Web apps**, on the other hand, are much lighter and designed to perform a single, specific task.

A good example is **Google Maps**, which offers useful features directly in your browser. With it, you can:

- Zoom in or out of a map;
- Move around the map;
- Search for places like restaurants;
- Get directions from one point to another.

*Main Advantages of Web Apps*

 1. **Access and Compatibility from Any Device** = Web apps store your data online, allowing you to access it from any device with an internet connection. Whether you’re using a Windows PC, a Mac, a tablet, or a smartphone, all you need is a browser — no need to carry your personal computer or worry about compatibility. This makes your work more flexible and user-friendly;

2. **Always Updated** = Web apps don’t need to be updated manually. Every time you open them, you’re already using the latest version with new features and security improvements, unlike traditional software that requires frequent and often slow updates;

3. **More Secure** = Since web apps run inside a browser and store data on secure online servers, they’re less exposed to malware or viruses. The separation between your device and the app's code provides an additional layer of protection.
